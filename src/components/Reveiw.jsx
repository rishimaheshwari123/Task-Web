          How we consistently achieve Merits and Distinctions in Dissertations?
        </h2>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          To produce such a dissertation and get high marks for it, you need to
          know how a dissertation is evaluated so that you can tailor it for a
          great evaluation. While these evaluations differ among different
          departments or universities the criteria is pretty much the same and
          may include the following:
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • Emphasis is mainly placed on the skill with which you have used the
          research methods to obtain scientifically presented findings as well
          as masterfully draw conclusions from these results.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • The dissertation should be original and relevant as well as
          demonstrate your ability to thoroughly conduct a research study.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • Your literature review should be relevant and very specific to your
          topic instead of an account of general information related to your
          field of study. The review should be both descriptive and critically
          analyze previous works while explicitly showing how his research
          methodology and the review are linked.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • The dissertation you present should have the research methodology
          appropriate and justified. You should minimize the likelihood of bias
          and limitations.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • The findings from your research should answer your research
          questions as well as meet your objectives. There should be no doubt as
          to the testing of your hypotheses
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • Your results should be well presented such that the patterns can be
          clearly identified and have been summarized.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • In your discussion, make a point of analyzing the main points first
          and speculations or reconceptualization should be well-founded in the
          results presented as well as linked to literature. Results should be
          interpreted exhaustively and innovatively related to the research
          hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • The reference list should give a complete and accurate account of
          sources used in the dissertation.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • Finally, there should be some recommendations for future studies.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "15px" }}>
          • Once the evaluation is done by supervisors and advisors who propose
          a grade that is either confirmed or rejected by a board of examiners,
          the final grade is given.
